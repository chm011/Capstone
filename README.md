## Project Title: H1B Visa Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Model Implementation  
## Authors: Christie Ma and Kenny Hwang
## Overview  
This Jupyter Notebook (`Final Notebook.ipynb`) contains the implementation of machine learning models for predicting **H1B visa approval outcomes**. The notebook includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and results visualization**.

##### tasks:
- "Load and preprocess the dataset"
- "Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)"
- "Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models"
- "Analyze results and compare the performance of models"
- 
##### expected_output:
- "EDA visualizations"
